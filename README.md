# Niyantri - Mock E-commerce Website

This project provides a small, fully responsive e-commerce front-end using Tailwind CSS with the following pages:

- index.html (Home) – shows category tiles linking to category pages
- electronics.html – shows electronics products and allows adding to cart
- home-products.html – shows home products
- clothes.html – shows clothing items
- cart.html – cart with a PayPal payment integration (sandbox)

All images are placeholders as required. The data is mocked via a simple in-browser API and stored in localStorage for cart persistence. The main layout stretches to full width using fluid Tailwind classes (no fixed-width containers).

How to run:
- Open the HTML files directly in a browser or serve them via a local server.
- The PayPal sandbox button will work with the client-id set to "sb" as a test mode.

Notes:
- This is a mock e-commerce storefront intended for demonstration and prototyping only.
- Ensure you have a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
